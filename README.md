## FCC-Front-End-Project-2
The portfolio project for Free Code Camp

This is the second **Front End Project** for [Free Code Camp](Http://www.freecodecamp.com/) 
The goal of the project is to create a portfolio page with specific goals in mind. Also it probably shouldn't look like total garbage, if AT ALL POSSIBLE. 

The goal of this project for Free Code Camp is to have the final submision somewhat similar to this [CodePen Site](https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/YqLyXB/)

##### Along with these guidelines given by Free Code Camp :thumbsup: :smiley:

- I can access all of the portfolio webpage's content just by scrolling
- I can click different buttons that will take me to the portfolio creator's different social media pages.
- I can see thumbnail images of different projects the portfolio creator has built (if you haven't built any websites before, use placeholders.)
- I navigate to different sections of the webpage by clicking buttons in the navigation.

So that's prety much it. Please feel free to contact me, or *send a pull request* via GitHub.

#### Thanks for reading
